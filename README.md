## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

[https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_random.asp to read about JS Math.random() functionality.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

[A challenge I encountered in creating this submission was my limited time. While the software development portion was doable, I had other commitments, midterms to study for, and assignments to work on. In order to overcome this without lowering the quality of my work, I stuck to a schedule that I had planned at the beginning of the week with rough estimates on the amount of hours each task would take. I left some room for breaks in order to ensure that the time I actually spent working was meaningful. By splitting up my work throughout the week, I was able to efficiently use my time without rushing through anything. ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[Some questions I have about web development relate to the network aspect of creating web pages. I am familiar with the concept of server and client, but would like to obtain a deeper understanding when it comes to developing web pages where multiple people can interact with one another at the same time. Furthermore, I'd like to learn more about connecting an HTML/CSS web page to a backend database to help with functionality. Ultimately, I hope to both learn more about front-end, client side coding, as well as gaining more practical experience with larger scale web pages.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would try to develop a scoring system. This score could be based on factors such as number of mistakes, time taken to guess the pattern, or even number of wins. Then, I would add a server that collected these scores from users and displayed the best scores. That way, the game would not feel as lonely and would create a sense of competition among users. Additionally, I would try to make the background a little less bland and develop a timer for each guess, to make scoring more skill-based. I would also add audio to the winGame() function, so that a celebratory audio file would play if a user guessed the pattern correctly.]
